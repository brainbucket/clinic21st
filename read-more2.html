                <strong> Preamble</strong><br />
                <br />

                With the 21st Century well set in, we can now see various
                changes in Indian Industries. Healthcare has attained the status
                of Industry and is no exception to such changes. Today’s
                patients are well informed and come with high expectations. The
                nature of diseases have changed, which has made communication,
                response time & visible quality as important ingredients. Third
                party endorsement is common and well sought after.<br />
                <br />

                Dental awareness in India is on the rise and many Dental
                Surgeons want their Clinics to meet recognized Standards. The
                expectations of patients have gone up and they are looking for
                third party accredited service providers. <br />
                <br />

                <strong> Dental Clinic Standards:</strong><br />
                <br />

                For Dental clinics, there is a very limited choice of Standards,
                the most popular being ISO 9001:2008 Certificate. This Standard,
                as it is, is not applicable completely and also is very
                expensive. There was an urgent need to identify a set of
                standards which are practical, affordable, transparent and
                effective in ensuring quality dental care. In order to address
                this issue, a Committee called “Committee for Dental Clinic
                Standards” was formed by Indian Dental Association Thane Branch
                in association with Forum for Enhancement of Quality in
                Healthcare (FEQH), Mumbai. Experts from various fields such as
                Healthcare, Medical Education, IT, Communication, Management
                Consultants & Media were chosen as Committee Members. <br />
                <br />

                The task before the committee was to decide upon minimum
                Standards for Dental Clinics, both for infrastructure and for
                Standard Operating Procedures. This was required in order to
                make these facilities more reliable, user friendly & safe, for
                patients as well as for Dental Surgeons and their staff
                members.. Due care was taken to make these Standards simple to
                understand, easy to implement and cost effective along with
                overall accountability to dental healthcare. <br />
                <br />

                <strong> Objectives of Accreditation: </strong>
              </p>

              <ul style="margin-left: 60px">
                <li>
                  Create optimum / Excellent Standards for dental healthcare
                  delivery in terms of infrastructure and equipments.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To follow standard operating procedures for dental health care
                  delivery.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To assist Dental Surgeons in creation of a safe and
                  infection-free environment.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br />

              Professional competence of dental surgeons and their decision of
              referral practice and clinical judgment in managing patients are
              out of purview of the standards.
